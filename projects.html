                    </header>
                    <p>Backpack Bailout is a scavenger hunt type escape game which was designed by a group of 3 students including myself using Unity game engine. This was a 12 weeks long project that required an immense amount of learning curve. Through this project I learned how to work in a team, honed my GitHub skills, learned how to program in C# and how to work with Unity Game Engine. </p>
                    <p>In the game, a fellow student loses her backpack and she needs it to ace her finals. However, a bully named "Chad" is in your way and tries to prevent you from helping her out. With the help of AJ you try to rescue the backpack by helping him clean the administration room while escaping Chad's fury. Failure to place all the objects in their respective spot in time could cause your classmate to fail her finals.</p>
                    <p>My job was to write AI scripts for all the NPCs (Non-Player Characters). A lot of technical details had to be learned which were documented in the "Project Development Timeline" below.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>The project was a robot that autonomously avoided collisions from walls and objects. An HC-SR04 sensor was used on a rotating head to determine the optimal path for traveling forward. Our navigation method was similar to many systems being used today. The most notable example is submarines, although it is mostly older submarines that still use SONAR. Similar to how advanced SONAR systems operate on a constant rotation, our robot had its sensor mounted on a rotating “head”. The robot swiveled its single sensor one-hundred-eighty degrees so that it could collect distance measurements in different directions. This method was selected to minimize the amount of new hardware required to get the robot working. The sensor has a trigger pin and an echo pin in addition to the Vcc and GND. The trigger pin stays high for 10 microseconds which sends 8 cycles of sonic burst that travel at the speed of sound. These waves are then detected by the echo pin which returns the travel time in microseconds. Finally, the distance is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in air (330 m/s or 0.034cm/µs) by time and dividing by 2 as the time obtained is the travel and return time of the sounds waves. The microcontroller used was an Arduino Uno and servos were used for the head and the wheels. A demo is presented below:</p>

                    <p>RPS X-treme is the next evolution of your favorite juvenile game - now you can settle your petty disputes from your handheld device, or set up tournaments to determine the alpha member of your entire friend group. To be exact, RPS X-treme is an Android application that makes it possible to set up/join lobbies for rock-paper-scissors matches/tournaments, and also keeps track of a variety of player performance statistics. Players will be able to log in and make or join a lobby.</p>

                    <p>This was a project for IEEE Power and Energy Society. The task was to simulate how resistor, capacitor, and inductor affect current and voltage in a circuit using water. My task was to design the PCB and get it manufactured. I used Eagle CAD to do so because it is open source and has a lot of resources for assitance. The PCB serveed as the central control unit of the system to which all the sensors and raspberry were connected for operation. Additionally, I helped with the design and assembly of the overall structure. Following is the image of the product. In operation, the LEDs dictate the flow of the water (i.e. current) and the LCD screen allows the user to perform KVL, KCL and other basic circuit analysis operations.</p>
