Backpack Bailout is a scavenger hunt type escape game which was designed by a group of 3 students including myself using Unity game engine. This was a 12 weeks long project that required an immense amount of learning curve. Through this project I learned how to work in a team, honed my GitHub skills, learned how to program in C# and how to work with Unity Game Engine. 
In the story, a fellow student loses her backpack and she needs it to ace her finals. However, a bully named "Chad" is in your way and tries to prevent you from helping her out. With the help of AJ you try to rescue the backpack by helping him clean the administration room while also trying to escaping from Chad's fury.. Failure to place all the objects in their respective spot in time could cause your classmate to fail her finals. A demo of the gameplay can be seen here.
My job was to write AI scripts for all the NPCs (Non-Player Characters). A lot of technical details had to be learned which were documented in the "Project Development Timeline" below.
