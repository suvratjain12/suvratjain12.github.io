The project was a robot that autonomously avoided collisions from walls and objects. An HC-SR04 sensor was used on a rotating head to determine the optimal path for traveling forward. Our navigation method was similar to many systems being used today. The most notable example is submarines, although it is mostly older submarines that still use SONAR. Similar to how advanced SONAR systems operate on a constant rotation, our robot had its sensor mounted on a rotating “head”. The robot swiveled its single sensor one-hundred-eighty degrees so that it could collect distance measurements in different directions. This method was selected to minimize the amount of new hardware required to get the robot working. The sensor has a trigger pin and an echo pin in addition to the Vcc and GND. The trigger pin stays high for 10 microseconds which sends 8 cycles of sonic burst that travel at the speed of sound. These waves are then detected by the echo pin which returns the travel time in microseconds. Finally, the distance is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in air (330 m/s or 0.034cm/µs) by time and dividing by 2 as the time obtained is the travel and return time of the sounds waves. The microcontroller used was an Arduino Uno and servos were used for the head and the wheels. A demo is presented below:
